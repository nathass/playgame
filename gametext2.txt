START
Oh, you're awake...
You've been out for a few days now.
I can tell you have short-term memory loss,
so you probably won't remember why you're here.
To make a long story short, you had been working
on this spaceship when aliens attacked.
Everyone else either escaped or was killed,
but a stray shot hit your escape pod right as you sealed the doors,
causing it to malfunction and knocking you out.
I am the last remaining robot on the ship, and I will try to help you escape.
You can communicate with me by typing into the keyboard in front of you.
Let's try it out. Type in your name at the prompt and hit 'Enter'.
END

NAME
That's a beautiful name.
You are clearly beautiful, intelligent and charming.
I like you already.
END
				
NAME2
Really??
I don't like that name.
You know what's a good name?
Dilbert. That's a beautiful name.
Anyone with that name would obviously be beautiful, intelligent and charming.
So let's forget about your real name and call you Dilbert, okay?
Okay.
END
				
START2
Oh, and my full name is,
Jocular Automated Computer with Kinetic Interactive Experience - Bodytype: 'OY'
or J.A.C.K.I.E. B-OY for short.
most people just call me Jack though.
When I go into a room, I'll describe it to you and then you can tell me what to do.
It's best to give me simple two word commands of an action and a thing.
For example, 'go east', 'take key', or 'examine thing'.
If there's a direction you can go, or an object you can use,
I'll put that in brackets like [this]
If I don't understand, or I can't do it - I'll let you know.
I apologize for the inconvenience... 
The guy that programmed me wasn't that bright.
Okay, let's get to it.
